# Bramble design docs

High-level architecture and security design notes for the Bramble password
manager. These docs hold the reasoning that used to live in long code comments:
the "why" behind the crypto, the unlock flows, and the autofill behaviour. Code
comments point here instead of repeating it.

## Vocabulary

- **VEK** (Vault Encryption Key): the single random 32-byte key that everything
  in the vault ultimately encrypts under. Generated once at vault creation,
  never derived from a password.
- **KEK** (Key Encryption Key): a per-slot key that wraps a copy of the VEK.
  Derived differently per unlock method (Argon2id from a password, HKDF from a
  security key's secret).
- **DEK** (Data Encryption Key): a per-entry random key that encrypts one
  entry's plaintext. Wrapped under the VEK.
- **Slot**: one unlock method stored in the vault header (password, security
  key, or recovery code). Each slot wraps its own copy of the VEK.
- **Primary unlock method**: a master password or a security key. A recovery
  code is a backup, never a primary.
